# Developers Developers DEVELOPERS Extension

This is a silly little project that make one of the many "developers" said by
Steve Ballmer play every time you hover the word "developer" (or "developers") on
a webpage. This pays homage to the now defunct [DEVELOPERS][orig] extension by
Todd Andersson. Now with one extra "developers"!

- [Chrome]() TBD
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/developers-developers/)
- [Edge]() TBD

The core of it is using manifest version 3 and an offscreen document to play
the sound effect, it's neat enough I guess.

Now also with a Firefox edition that uses the extended background scripts
capabilities firefox still supports for manifest version 3, rather than
supporting web workers.
